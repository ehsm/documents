<h2>Why is it at the same time as the 29C3?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The EHSM theme is complementary to that of the CCC, the latter having a strong focus on security and politics and little focus on open hardware. We want to contribute on the latter.</li>
<li>You can easily go to both events, and transportation between the BCC and TU is &lt; 30min. CCC is 4 days, EHSM is 3.</li>
<li>The CCC has become so popular that it has had to refuse people for the last few years.</li>
<li>There are actually hackers who travel to Berlin at those dates just to hang around. Seize this opportunity to learn about sides of hardware hacking you might have never seen.</li>
<li>It's easier to get a room during this period. We can save money on the room and spend more on the content.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>I want to speak. When should I submit?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>As soon as possible and before October 15th.</li>
<li>We will confirm and announce some speakers approximately every month (depending on ticket sales).</li> <li>Submitting early gives you more time to prepare your travel.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Can I go there if I cannot afford the ticket price?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Write a note to orga AT ehsm dot eu to propose your help. In exchange for a few hours of volunteering, you can enjoy the rest of the conference. All volunteering agreements have to be confirmed at least one month before the start of the conference.</li>
<li>Yes. Crash the gate and don't get caught.</li>
</ul>
