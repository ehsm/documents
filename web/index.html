Collaboration between open source and research communities empowers open
hardware to explore new grounds and hopefully deliver on the "third
industrial revolution". The first edition of the Exceptionally Hard and
Soft Meeting featured lectures delivered by <strong>international makers,
hackers, scientists and engineers</strong> on topics such as nuclear fusion, chip
design, vacuum equipment machining, and applied quantum physics.
Tutorials gave a welcoming hands-on introduction to people of all
levels, including kids.
</p>

<p>
EHSM is back in summer 2014 for another edition of <strong>the most cutting-edge</strong>
open source conference. This year we are proud to welcome you to an
exceptional venue: <strong>DESY, Europe's second-largest particle physics
laboratory!</strong>

<h3>Speakers: submit your presentation</h3>
<p>
Is there a device in your basement that demonstrates violations of
Bell's inequalities? We want to see it in action. Are you starting up a
company to build nuclear fusion reactors? Tell us about it. Does your
open source hardware or software run some complex, advanced and
beautiful scientific instruments? We are eager to learn about it. Do you
have stories to tell about your former job manufacturing ultra high
vacuum equipment in the Soviet Union? We want to hear about your
experiences. Do you have a great design for a difficult open source
product that can be useful to millions? Team up with the people who can
help implement your ideas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Whoever you are, wherever you come from, you are welcome to present
technologically awesome work at EHSM.</strong> Travel assistance and visa
invitation letters provided upon request. All lectures are in English.
</p>

<p>
This year, we will try to improve the conference's documentation by
publishing proceedings. When relevant, please send us a paper on your
presentation topic. We are OK with previously published work, we simply
expect high quality and up-to-date content.
</p>

<p>
To submit your presentation, <strong>send a mail to team@ehsm.eu</strong> with typically
the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name(s). You can be anonymous if you prefer.</li>
<li>Short bio</li>
<li>Title of the presentation</li>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>How much time you would like</li>
<li>Full paper (if applicable)</li>
<li>Links to more information (if available)</li>
<li>Contact information (e-mail + mobile phone if possible)</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you need us to arrange your trip:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you would be traveling from</li>
<li>If you need accommodation in Hamburg</li>
</ul>

<p>
We will again have an exhibition area where you can show and demonstrate
your work - write to the same email address to apply for space. If you
are bringing bulky or high-power equipment, make sure to let us know:
<ul>
<li>What surface you would use</li>
<li>What assistance you would need for equipment transport between your lab and the conference</li>
<li>If you need 3-phase electric power (note that Germany uses 230V/400V 50Hz)</li>
<li>What the peak power of your installation would be</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Tutorials on any technology topic are also welcome, and may cater to all
levels, including beginners and kids.
</p>

<p>We acknowledge receipt of all submission emails; if you have not heard from us one week after your application, it means we have not received your message. Write again or call +4917639295103.</p>

<p>
We are counting on you to make this event awesome. Feel free to nominate
