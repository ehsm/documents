Exceptionally Hard &amp; Soft Meeting<br />
exploring the frontiers of open source and DIY<br />

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nebarnix/7122814537/sizes/l/in/set-72157626392355425/"><img src="jaspernance_cold_cathode.jpg" alt="Photo by Jasper Nance, used with permission" style="float: right"></a>Some electronics books from the 50s claimed making triode tubes would be
an impossible endeavour for amateurs. Today, there are at least two DIY
laboratories making not only triodes but also all sorts of vacuum
electron devices.<br />
Three years after the first GPS satellite was launched, few people used
the technology, which was perceived as very complicated and expensive.
Yet, someone successfully operated his homebrew receiver made from
hundreds of that time's electronic parts.<br />
These days, microchips are often thought to be impenetrable and
impossible to manufacture without large-scale facilities. But many
individuals are reverse engineering microelectronics designs, often
breaking security systems based on the obscurity of the silicon layout.
Some are even devising DIY methods to replicate parts of the microchip
manufacturing process, with impressive results.<br />
What are the frontiers of DIY technology? The first Exceptionally Hard &amp;
Soft Meeting (EHSM) will feature presentations of the brightest DIY
achievements. But we do not want to stop at DIY. In fact, we should not,
because teamwork is the only way to get the big things done.<br />
The open source ethos is about keeping the freedom and openness of DIY
when many people are involved. At a time when thousands of developers
from hundreds of companies contribute to Linux and the world's largest
physics laboratories share openly licensed hardware designs on OHWR, we
will explore the cutting-edge open source hardware and software
practices.<br />
This premiere of the EHSM was held in Berlin on December 28-30 2012. It was awesome.

<tr><td>Day#1 11:45 - 13:00</td><td bgcolor="#eed"><img src="s_willjack.jpg"></td><td bgcolor="#eed"><b>Keynote Speech: Will Jack - "I built myself a nuclear fusion reactor when I was 16"</b><br /><a href="http://wjscience.com">Will Jack</a> is a 17 year old high school student from the US who enjoys nothing more than building nuclear fusion reactors in his basement. He will present his work on the Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) fusion reactors that he has built, speaking not only about the theory behind them, but how he developed them, his current work, and his goals for the future as well.<br><em>This keynote speech is not about cloud computing.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Day#1 10:30 - 11:45</td><td><img src="s_bionerd.jpg"></td><td><b>Bionerd23 - Radioactivity is in the air for you and me</b><br />An anonymous woman who goes by the handle of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bionerd23">bionerd23</a>" will give you a very comprehensive, bottom-up view of man-made and natural nuclear radiation and how you can detect it. Mind you - when we say "comprehensive", this means things like building yourself ion chambers for detecting radiation, and studying and operating a small-scale homemade fusion reactor. Have a look at her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bionerd23">excellent videos</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Day#1 17:30 - 18:00</td><td><img src="s_evangeliagousiou.jpg"></td><td><b>Evangelia Gousiou - Open Hardware at CERN</b><br />Evangelia Gousiou will tell you about the Open Hardware Initiative at CERN, covering various aspects, such as the <a href="http://ohwr.org">Open Hardware Repository</a>, the <a href="http://ohwr.org/cernohl">CERN Open Hardware Licence</a>, the commercial paradigm used in collaborating with companies and current efforts to boost FOSS tools for hardware development.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Day#2 10:00 - 11:15</td><td><img src="s_benkrasnow.jpg"></td><td><b>Ben Krasnow - Homebuilt X-ray backscatter imaging system (airport body scanner)</b><br /><a href="http://benkrasnow.blogspot.com">Ben Krasnow</a>, "Hacker Extraordinaire" at video game company Valve, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7ldYhzKAp4">built an X-ray backscatter imaging system</a> from parts found on eBay. This system works by scanning a very thin beam of X-rays across the target, and measures the amount of backscatter for a given beam position. The beam is scanned mechanically by a rotating chopper (collimator) wheel, and by tilting the rotating wheel on an orthogonal axis. The output image is generated on an oscilloscope by matching the horizontal scan speed to the rotating wheel, and using a potentiometer to measure the vertical axis position. The scope's brightness (z axis) is controlled by the amount of backscatter signal received by a large-area detector. Thus, the image is constructed bit by bit.<br />He might 
also 
talk about Raman spectroscopy and other hacks, stay tuned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Day#3 12:30 - 13:00</td><td><img src="s_triode.jpg"></td><td><b>Aleksander Zawada - DIY triodes and other vacuum tubes</b><br />Aleksander runs <a href="http://tubedevices.com/alek/pwl/pwl_e.htm">"Prywatna Wytwórnia Lamp" (PWL)</a>, a one-man DIY vacuum tube laboratory in Warsaw. The name translates to "Private Tube Manufacturer" - a pun on PWLR ("National Tube Manufacturer"), the first Polish tube manufacturer after WWII. There, he makes not only triodes, but also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anode_ray">canal ray</a> tubes, a RGB <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_eye_tube">magic eye</a>, several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_tube">Crookes</a> tubes, Geiger tubes, and many other incredibly amazing devices. This is serious stuff - he starts with raw materials like glass, metal and phosphor powders.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Day#3 18:15 - 19:30</td><td><img src="s_jaspernance.jpg"></td><td><b><a href="http://www.nebarnix.com">Jasper Nance</a> - Microsecond High Speed Photography and Scanning Electron Microscope</b><br />She will present these projects from the perspective of using community resources, specifically those from <a href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/">Heatsync Labs</a>, Arizona's first hackerspace. This includes materials, people, expertise, and crowdsourcing to scrounge and hack together technologically challenging endeavours. The projects are not an end in themselves, but rather serve as hackable platforms for both community and educational outreach to teach skills and develop new and hackable ways of doing difficult and expensive tasks. For a quick glimpse at Jasper's projects, be sure to check <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nebarnix/">her impressive photo portfolio</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Day#3 15:45 - 17:00</td><td><img src="s_haraldwelte.jpg"></td><td><b>Harald Welte - Osmocom</b><br /><a href="http://gnumonks.org/users/laforge/">Harald Welte</a> will present the <a href="http://osmocom.org/">Osmocom</a> project he founded. In particular, there will be OsmocomBB, a free software GSM stack evolved enough to actually make phone calls and send SMS (plus all the possible explorations of the GSM system), and OsmoSDR, a small-size, low-cost software defined radio device.</td></tr>
