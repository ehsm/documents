Exceptionally Hard &amp; Soft Meeting<br />
exploring the frontiers of open source and DIY<br />

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nebarnix/7122814537/sizes/l/in/set-72157626392355425/"><img src="jaspernance_cold_cathode.jpg" alt="Photo by Jasper Nance, used with permission" style="float: right"></a>Some electronics books from the 50s claimed making triode tubes would be
an impossible endeavour for amateurs. Today, there are at least two DIY
laboratories making not only triodes but also all sorts of vacuum
electron devices.<br />
Three years after the first GPS satellite was launched, few people used
the technology, which was perceived as very complicated and expensive.
Yet, someone successfully operated his homebrew receiver made from
hundreds of that time's electronic parts.<br />
These days, microchips are often thought to be impenetrable and
impossible to manufacture without large-scale facilities. But many
individuals are reverse engineering microelectronics designs, often
breaking security systems based on the obscurity of the silicon layout.
Some are even devising DIY methods to replicate parts of the microchip
manufacturing process, with impressive results.<br />
What are the frontiers of DIY technology? The first Exceptionally Hard &amp;
Soft Meeting (EHSM) will feature presentations of the brightest DIY
achievements. But we do not want to stop at DIY. In fact, we should not,
because teamwork is the only way to get the big things done.<br />
The open source ethos is about keeping the freedom and openness of DIY
when many people are involved. At a time when thousands of developers
from hundreds of companies contribute to Linux and the world's largest
physics laboratories share openly licensed hardware designs on OHWR, we
will explore the cutting-edge open source hardware and software
practices.<br />
This premiere of the EHSM will be held in Berlin on December 28-30 2012.
Everyone is welcome to attend it. Curiosity is enough to qualify, and
we have kept the minimal entrance fee affordable. Please <a href="tickets.html">order your
ticket</a> as soon as possible, to help us make this event happen.

<h2>They are already coming</h2>

To give you an idea of what is coming up, we are pleased to announce
that the following speakers will be presenting their awesome work:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.warrantyvoidifremoved.com">Jeffrey Gough</a> will talk about and demonstrate metalwork techniques. How to go beyond extruded ABS coming from a 3D printer? There might even be a hands-on workshop coming up, stay tuned.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aeste.my">Shawn Tan</a> has been working on a new open source microprocessor design and will introduce it at EHSM.</li>
<li><a href="http://benkrasnow.blogspot.com">Ben Krasnow</a> makes all sorts of seemingly impossible science experiments at home, such as creating aerogel (yes, that thing on spacecraft), Pop Rocks candy, or building a scanning electron microscope. He will talk about a yet undisclosed but promising topic.</li>
</ul>
<b>NEW June 18th:</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nebarnix.com">Jasper Nance</a> will present her Microsecond High Speed Photography and Scanning Electron Microscope projects from the perspective of using community resources, specifically those from <a href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/">Heatsync Labs</a>, Arizona's first hackerspace. This includes materials, people, expertise, and crowdsourcing to scrounge and hack together technologically challenging endeavours. The projects are not an end in themselves, but rather serve as hackable platforms for both community and educational outreach to teach skills and develop new and hackable ways of doing difficult and expensive tasks.
For a quick glimpse at Jasper's projects, be sure to check <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nebarnix/">her impressive photo portfolio</a>.</li>
<li>An anonymous woman who goes by the handle of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bionerd23">bionerd23</a>" will give you a very comprehensive, bottom-up view of man-made and natural nuclear radiation and how you can detect it. Mind you - when we say "comprehensive", this means things like building yourself ion chambers for detecting radiation, and studying and operating a small-scale homemade fusion reactor. Have a look at her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bionerd23">excellent videos</a>.</li>

<li>Where the speaker will be traveling from</li>
<li>Title of the presentation</li>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Links to more information (if available)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The standard format for presentations is one-hour lectures, but we are
