	<p>Exceptionally Hard & Soft Meeting<br />
exploring the frontiers of open source and DIY<br />
       Berlin, December 28-30 2012</p>

	<div id="intro">
<p>Some electronics books from the 50s claimed making triode tubes would be
an impossible endeavour for amateurs. Today, there are at least two DIY
laboratories making not only triodes but also all sorts of vacuum
electron devices.</p>
<p>Three years after the first GPS satellite was launched, few people used
the technology, which was perceived as very complicated and expensive.
Yet, someone successfully operated his homebrew receiver made from
hundreds of that time's electronic parts.</p>
<p>These days, microchips are often thought to be impenetrable and
impossible to manufacture without large-scale facilities. But many
individuals are reverse engineering microelectronics designs, often
breaking security systems based on the obscurity of the silicon layout.
Some are even devising DIY methods to replicate parts of the microchip
manufacturing process, with impressive results.</p>
<p>What are the frontiers of DIY technology? The first Exceptionally Hard &
Soft Meeting (EHSM) will feature presentations of the brightest DIY
achievements. But we do not want to stop at DIY. In fact, we should not,
because teamwork is the only way to get the big things done.</p>
<p>The open source ethos is about keeping the freedom and openness of DIY
when many people are involved. At a time when thousands of developers
from hundreds of companies contribute to Linux and the world's largest
physics laboratories share openly licensed hardware designs on OHWR, we
will explore the cutting-edge open source hardware and software
practices.</p>
<p>This premiere of the EHSM will be held in Berlin on December 28-30 2012.
Everyone is welcome to attend it. Curiosity is enough to qualify, and
we have kept the minimal entrance fee affordable. Please <a href="tickets.html">order your
ticket</a> as soon as possible, to help us make this event happen.</p>

<h2>They are already coming</h2>
<p>To give you an idea of what is coming up, we are pleased to announce
that the following speakers will be presenting their awesome work:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.warrantyvoidifremoved.com">Jeffrey Gough</a> will talk about and demonstrate metalwork techniques. How to go beyond extruded ABS coming from a 3D printer? There might even be a hands-on workshop coming up, stay tuned.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aeste.my">Shawn Tan</a> has been working on a new open source microprocessor design and will introduce it at EHSM.</li>
</ul>
<p>More speakers will be announced as we confirm them, check this space!</p>

<h2>Tickets and funding</h2>
<p>EHSM is entirely supported by its attendees and sponsors. To help us make this
event happen, please <a href="tickets.html">donate and/or order your ticket</a> as soon as possible.
EHSM is a non-profit event and most of the money will be used to cover
speakers' travel expenses.</p>

<h2>Submit your presentation</h2>
<p>Since we do not pretend to be aware of all the amazing tech out there, we
are expecting your proposals.</p>

<li>Where the speaker will be traveling from</li>
<li>Title of the presentation</li>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Links to more information (if available)</li>
</ul></p>

requirements.</p>

<p>We are waiting for your presentations in these areas:
<ul>
<li>Open hardware</li>
<li>Big open source project management</li>
<li>Licensing and business models for open source</li>
<li>Manufacturing: metalwork, glass blowing, ...</li>

...and anything awesome which is not listed here.</p>

<p>If you know of someone else's work that would be relevant, feel free to
tip us! (orga AT ehsm.eu)</p>

<h2>For academia</h2>
<p>While researchers are most welcome to present their work at EHSM, please
note that this is not a traditional academic conference. We will not
formally publish proceedings(*), and we do not claim affiliation with
any institution. We are also OK with previously published work, we
simply expect high-quality presentations.</p>

<p>(*) <a href="http://www.thecostofknowledge.com">Contrary to the practice of most academic publishers</a>, we will,
however, do our best to ensure the free dissemination of information.</p>
