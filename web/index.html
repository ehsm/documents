Collaboration between open source and research communities empowers open
hardware to explore new grounds and hopefully deliver on the "third
industrial revolution". The first edition of the Exceptionally Hard and
Soft Meeting featured lectures delivered by <strong>international makers,
hackers, scientists and engineers</strong> on topics such as nuclear fusion, chip
design, vacuum equipment machining, and applied quantum physics.
Tutorials gave a welcoming hands-on introduction to people of all
levels, including kids.
</p>

<p>
EHSM is back in summer 2014 for another edition of <strong>the most cutting-edge</strong>
open source conference. This year we are proud to welcome you to an
exceptional venue: <strong>DESY, Europe's second-largest particle physics
laboratory!</strong>

<h3>Programme</h3>

<h4>[Tutorial] Bending Glass in Flames</h4>

<p><img src="glassworking.jpg" style="float: right;">
This workshop will demonstrate the art of flame-working as you discover the different properties of glass and how it bends! And we will combine artistic and scientific flameworking techniques to create those wonderful glass beads you see everywhere! Through demonstrations and individual instruction, you can have a go at experimenting with centuries-old glassmaking technique.</p>

<p><img src="nadania.jpg" style="float: right;">
<b>Instructor:</b>
Nadania Idriss is a PhD candidate at the Free University in
Berlin, writing on contemporary art involving glass by artists from the
Middle East. She first came into contact with glass while studying at
the University of Washington in Seattle. She currently lives
in Berlin, working at the Museum of Islamic Art, and founded and directs
<a href="http://berlinglas.org/">Berlin Glas e.V.</a>, a non-profit public access glass studio.
</p>

<h4>[Tutorial] Learn to Solder</h4>

<p><img src="mitch_solder.jpg" style="float: right;"> A large variety of way cool kits are available, all designed for total beginners to complete successfully - and intriguing enough for the hardware geek. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman">Mitch Altman</a> will have kits available for making cool, practical, intriguing, hackable things that you can bring home after you make it.</p>

<p>Plenty of cool kits are available to make, including  TV-B-Gone (turn off TVs in public places!), Mignonette Game, LEDcube (animated 3D cube!), microcontroller programmers (program all your AVR family chips!), Arduino clones, Open Heart (animate fun patterns in the shape of a heart!), Atari Punk Console (make cool noise from an Altoids tin!), and many more.</p>

<p>Cost: Instruction is free, we ask that people pay only for the cost of the parts used; kit prices range from 10&euro; to 30&euro;. <strong>Suitable for kids</strong>, accompanied minors (-18) do not need a EHSM ticket.</p>

<h4>Inside the Genome Sequencing Revolution: Under the hood of an Illumina Sequencer</h4>

<p><img src="dna.png" style="float: right;">
Since the introduction of 'next-generation' sequencers, the cost of sequencing a single human genome has fallen exponentially; even <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/DNA_Sequencing_Cost_per_Genome_Over_Time.jpg">much faster than Moore's Law</a>. Modern fluorescence-based genome sequencers are complex instruments that can sequence billions of basepairs in a matter of days by sequencing millions of fragments of a genome in parallel. In this talk, I show how we have deconstructed one of the pioneering <a href="http://www.illumina.com/">Illumina</a> instruments, explain how it works, and show how we have managed to reconstruct an automated fluorescence imaging microscope system from scrapped Illumina sequencer parts.</p>

<h4>Open Source Verilog HDL Synthesis with Yosys</h4>

<p><img src="clifford_wolf.jpg" style="float: right;">
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> is the first full-featured open source software for Verilog HDL
synthesis. It supports most of Verilog-2005 and is well tested with
real-world designs from the ASIC and FPGA world.</p>

<p>Learn how to use Yosys to create your own custom synthesis flow and
discover why open source HDL synthesis is important for researchers,
hobbyists, educators and engineers alike.</p>

<p>The presentation covers basic concepts of Yosys and writing simple
synthesis scripts. There will be also a workshop covering advanced topics.</p>

<p>Yosys is the first step towards a fully open FPGA/ASIC toolchain, and is currently used with vendor place-and-route tools.</p>

<p><b>Speaker</b>: 
Clifford Wolf writes open source software and is active in the open source
and Linux community since the mid 90s. His prior projects include the Linux
distribution build kit <a href="http://rocklinux.net/">ROCK Linux</a> and the 3D CAD modeller <a href="http://openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a>. Since
2012 he is working on Yosys.</p>

<h4>Principles of Mass Spectrometry</h4>

<p>
<img src="massspec.jpg" style="float: right;">
Mass spectrometry is a very useful tool in solid-state physics research and material analysis.</p>

<p>The presentation will cover three spectrometry techniques: Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GDMS) and Spark Source Mass Spectrometry (SSMS).</p>

<p>It will explain the principles of operation and the construction of example devices and their "hearts" - quadrupole and double focusing mass spectrometers.</p>

<p>For a mass spectrometer to work, the analyzed material needs to be ionized first. The talk will show how that happens in SIMS, GDMS and SSMS.</p>

<p>Finally, the presentation will show sample measurement results.</p>

<p><b>Speaker</b>:
Maciej Miśnik is affiliated with the Vacuum Measurement Laboratory of the <a href="http://www.itr.org.pl/en/">Tele- and Radio Research Institute</a> in Warsaw, and the <a href="http://pg.edu.pl/welcome">Gdańsk University of Technology</a>.
