Exceptionally Hard &amp; Soft Meeting<br />
exploring the frontiers of open source and DIY<br />

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nebarnix/7122814537/sizes/l/in/set-72157626392355425/"><img src="jaspernance_cold_cathode.jpg" alt="Photo by Jasper Nance, used with permission" style="float: right"></a>Some electronics books from the 50s claimed making triode tubes would be
an impossible endeavour for amateurs. Today, there are at least two DIY
laboratories making not only triodes but also all sorts of vacuum
electron devices.<br />
Three years after the first GPS satellite was launched, few people used
the technology, which was perceived as very complicated and expensive.
Yet, someone successfully operated his homebrew receiver made from
hundreds of that time's electronic parts.<br />
These days, microchips are often thought to be impenetrable and
impossible to manufacture without large-scale facilities. But many
individuals are reverse engineering microelectronics designs, often
breaking security systems based on the obscurity of the silicon layout.
Some are even devising DIY methods to replicate parts of the microchip
manufacturing process, with impressive results.<br />
What are the frontiers of DIY technology? The first Exceptionally Hard &amp;
Soft Meeting (EHSM) will feature presentations of the brightest DIY
achievements. But we do not want to stop at DIY. In fact, we should not,
because teamwork is the only way to get the big things done.<br />
The open source ethos is about keeping the freedom and openness of DIY
when many people are involved. At a time when thousands of developers
from hundreds of companies contribute to Linux and the world's largest
physics laboratories share openly licensed hardware designs on OHWR, we
will explore the cutting-edge open source hardware and software
practices.<br />
This premiere of the EHSM will be held in Berlin on December 28-30 2012.
Everyone is welcome to attend it. Curiosity is enough to qualify, and
we have kept the minimal entrance fee affordable.

<h2>Tickets and funding</h2>
<p>EHSM is entirely supported by its attendees and donors. To help us make this
event happen, please <a href="tickets.html">donate and/or order your ticket</a> as soon as possible.
EHSM is a non-profit event and most of the money will be used to cover
speakers' travel expenses.</p>

<h2>They are already coming</h2>
<p>

To give you an idea of what is coming up, we are pleased to announce
that the following speakers will be presenting their awesome work:
<table>
<tr><td><img src="s_changers.jpg"></td><td>Daniela Schiffer and Markus Schulz will present their startup <a href="http://www.changers.com">Changers</a>, the solar charger they have developed and the vision behind what they are doing. Imagine what would happen if every single one of us could produce their own energy and by that creating a currency. Even though Changers' particular business model is not compatible with open source, their story is an inspiring example of how persistence and willingness to leave the beaten path can lead to the successful design and production of consumer electronics in a startup environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_mitch.jpg"></td><td><a href="http://www.cornfieldelectronics.com">Mitch Altman</a> will give a hands-on soldering workshop for kids and other newcomers. Learn how to solder by building a simple and fun electronic kit! Minors (-18) get into EHSM for free, kits cost 10€.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nebarnix/5380563828/sizes/l/in/set-72157626469795530/"><img src="jaspernance_wine_flute.jpg" alt="Photo by Jasper Nance, used with permission"></a></center></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_haraldwelte.jpg"></td><td><a href="http://gnumonks.org/users/laforge/">Harald Welte</a> will present the <a href="http://osmocom.org/">Osmocom</a> project he founded. In particular, there will be OsmocomBB, a free software GSM stack evolved enough to actually make phone calls and send SMS (plus all the possible explorations of the GSM system), and OsmoSDR, a small-size, low-cost software defined radio device.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_evangeliagousiou.jpg"></td><td>Last year, <a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/releases2011/PR08.11E.html">CERN launched</a> a new open hardware license. <a href="http://www.ohwr.org/users/61">Evangelia Gousiou</a> will tell you about this endeavour which was created to govern the use, copying, modification and distribution of hardware design documentation and the manufacture and distribution of products in the spirit of knowledge and technology dissemination.<br />
For the more technically-minded, she will also present the <a href="http://www.ohwr.org/projects/white-rabbit">White Rabbit</a>, an open hardware and software Ethernet-based system to synchronize ~1000 nodes with sub-nanosecond accuracy over fiber and copper lengths of up to 10 km.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_nadaniaidriss.jpg"></td><td>Nadania Idriss is a California transplant who founded <a href="http://www.berlinglas.org">Berlin Glas</a> e.V. in 2009. The studio is the first in Berlin to offer hot glass for artists and the general public. Check out her short presentation to learn how you too can work with this material! (glass blowing etc.)</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_jaspernance.jpg"></td><td><a href="http://www.nebarnix.com">Jasper Nance</a> will present her Microsecond High Speed Photography and Scanning Electron Microscope projects from the perspective of using community resources, specifically those from <a href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/">Heatsync Labs</a>, Arizona's first hackerspace. This includes materials, people, expertise, and crowdsourcing to scrounge and hack together technologically challenging endeavours. The projects are not an end in themselves, but rather serve as hackable platforms for both community and educational outreach to teach skills and develop new and hackable ways of doing difficult and expensive tasks.
For a quick glimpse at Jasper's projects, be sure to check <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nebarnix/">her impressive photo portfolio</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_bionerd.jpg"></td><td>An anonymous woman who goes by the handle of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bionerd23">bionerd23</a>" will give you a very comprehensive, bottom-up view of man-made and natural nuclear radiation and how you can detect it. Mind you - when we say "comprehensive", this means things like building yourself ion chambers for detecting radiation, and studying and operating a small-scale homemade fusion reactor. Have a look at her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bionerd23">excellent videos</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_jeffreygough.jpg"></td><td><a href="http://www.warrantyvoidifremoved.com">Jeffrey Gough</a> will talk about and demonstrate metalwork techniques. How to go beyond extruded ABS coming from a 3D printer? There might even be a hands-on workshop coming up, stay tuned.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_shawntan.jpg"></td><td><a href="http://www.aeste.my">Shawn Tan</a> has been working on a new open source microprocessor design and will introduce it at EHSM.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="s_benkrasnow.jpg"></td><td><a href="http://benkrasnow.blogspot.com">Ben Krasnow</a> makes all sorts of seemingly impossible science experiments at home, such as creating aerogel (yes, that thing on spacecraft), Pop Rocks candy, or building a scanning electron microscope. One of his latest hacks is to <a href="http://benkrasnow.blogspot.ch/2012/07/attempting-to-make-x-rays-by-unrolling_09.html">make X-rays by unrolling Scotch tape</a>. He will talk about a yet undisclosed but promising topic.</td></tr>
