<h3>Programme</h3>

<h4>The mor1kx OpenRISC processor</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx">mor1kx</a> is a OpenRISC 1000 compliant softcore microprocessor written in Verilog. The initial motivation for the work at its inception was to provide a code base which would be friendly to multiple pipeline implementations, encouraging a high degree of reuse of common blocks. It initially saw the development of 3 different pipelines, each providing a different trade-off between area and performance. The most high-end pipeline has subsequently been honed by its developers to contain more features and better performance than the original OR1K processor, the OR1200. Recent work includes cache and MMU features which improve the performance of software such as the Linux kernel. Other interesting work has been on enabling multi-core capability. This talk will present the OpenRISC project, the core and its current status, comment on its development environment (a nod to other open source EDA efforts), licensing, and current uses in various projects.</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="http://juliusbaxter.net">Julius Baxter</a> is a digital design engineer who has been involved with the OpenRISC project for over 5 years. In that time he's dabbled with everything from RTL and the Linux kernel, to debuggers and licensing.</p>

<h4>Smelting at the Electrolab</h4>

<p><img src="smelting.jpg" style="float: right;">In a hackerspace, people often build things using various rapid manufacturing techniques. 3D printing, machining, laser cutting are common, but sometimes members need some bulky metal parts that are difficult to machine from a blank. Enter DIY smelting and casting, which is already a fun thing to do by itself, but is even funnier when it's elevated to a rapid manufacturing technique available to our members to build their projects. We will present our prototype furnace, some objects created with it in our hackerspace, and our current work on the "production" furnace, that will be able to melt 6 liters of aluminium, brass, copper, iron, etc... and also to convert cast iron into steel by controlling the amount of carbon. Some time will be dedicated to presenting the work in progress towards the <a href="http://electrolab.fr">Electrolab</a> v2.0.</p>

<p><b>Speakers:</b> Sebastien Lorquet is a smart card and secure embedded software engineer during the day, and a hacker during the night. He's also an amateur radio operator and spends its free time experimenting with microwaves, electronics, mechanics and physics.</p>
<p>Tom Brelet is a Master's Degree student, intern at Peugeot, in a R&amp;D team. He has worked on a lot of personal projects involving soldering, melting, cutting and machining metal, most of them in his student bedroom.
<p>Jordi Erra is also a Master's Degree student, intern at Air Liquide R&amp;D, and by night he is an active hacker, with a specialty in cold-producing machines.</p>
<p>All are active members of the <a href="http://electrolab.fr">Electrolab</a> hackerspace, which provides them with important technical and human resources to work on more ambitious projects.</p>

<h4>The eXperimental Robot Project</h4>

<p><img src="xrpbot.png" style="float: right;">The goal of the <a href="http://www.xrpbot.org/">eXperimental Robot Project</a> (XRP) is to develop an open-hardware humanoid robot - or, more precisely, a bipedal walking machine. Much of the work until now has been on studying walking in simulation. In addition, to explore the application of optimization-based control to real world systems, we are currently building a so-called Acrobot (a double pendulum where only the middle joint is actuated).</p>

<p>In the talk, we will present the physics of walking and how a successful walking machine can be built, at least in simulation. We will then discuss our plans for moving from simulation to actual hardware.</p>

<p><b>Speakers:</b> Norbert Braun and Felix Schneider are two robotics enthusiasts based in Cologne, who have been developing electronics and mechanics together since several years at <a href="http://dingfabrik.de/">DingFabrik</a>, a local hackerspace. Past projects include a 1200x600mm CO2 laser cutter (based on Lasersaur), a <a href="http://pcbwriter.github.io">UV laser PCB exposure device</a> and several smaller projects around the hackerspace (bell system, CNC router, ...). In the meantime we are continuously working on the XRPBot project. Norbert is doing most of the simulations, while Felix takes the lead on the mechanical design.</p>

<h4>The Open Source Network Tester on NetFPGA-10G </h4>

<p><img src="osnt.jpg" style="float: right;">Despite network monitoring and testing being critical for computer networks, current solutions are both extremely expensive and inflexible. Into this lacuna we launch the Open Source Network Tester (OSNT), a fully open-source traffic generator and capture system. Our prototype implementation on the <a href="http://netfpga.org/10G_specs.html">NetFPGA-10G</a> supports 4x10Gbps traffic generation across all packet sizes and traffic capture is supported up to 2x10Gbps with native host software. Our system implementation provides methods for scaling and coordinating multiple generator/capture systems and supports 6.25ns timestamp resolution with clock drift and phase coordination maintained by a GPS input. Additionally, our approach has demonstrated lower-cost than comparable commercial systems while achieving comparable levels of precision and accuracy; all within an open-source framework extensible with new features to support new applications, while permitting validation and review of the implementation.</p>

<p><b>Speakers:</b> <img src="marc_bruyere.jpg" style="float: right;">Marc Bruyere is a PhD Student at the <a href="http://www.laas.fr">LAAS/CNRS</a> and a Dell Force10 employee. His thesis is about network monitoring on programmable hardware. Used to be NOC member at the CCC congress, co-founder of the non profit ISP <a href="http://tetaneutral.net">tetaneutral.net</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://snootlab.com">Snootlab</a> and founder of the <a href="http://thsf.tetalab.org">Toulouse HackerSpace Factory</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Gianni Antichi is a Research Associate at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge Computer Laboratory</a>. Dr. Antichi received the B.E. and the M.E. degrees in telecommunications engineering and the PhD degree in information engineering from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 2005, 2007, and 2011, respectively. His research interests are in the area of hardware accelerated networking systems, network design, network monitoring, packet classification and software defined networks.</p>

<h4>Porting NetBSD to the LatticeMico32 open source CPU</h4>

<p>In this presentation, I will describe the work I did on the open source LatticeMico32 softcore CPU to add a MMU (Memory Management Unit) to its pipeline and then how I added support for this enhanced LM32 CPU in the <a href="http://netbsd.org">NetBSD</a> 6 kernel.</p>

<p>I will first quickly introduce the LatticeMico32 CPU and what FPGAs can do. Then I will focus on explaining what a MMU is and how the current MMU design that was added to LM32 works. I will then show an overview of the steps you need to accomplish to add support for a new CPU and a new System-on-Chip to the NetBSD kernel. Afterward I will explain some of the choices made for this port, especially those in relation with the handling of the MMU by the NetBSD kernel: the (machine-dependent) virtual memory system (aka pmap).</p>

<p>I will (try to) demo the boot of the NetBSD kernel on QEMU emulating LM32 CPU the and then on the Milkymist One board.</p>

<p><img src="yann_sionneau.jpg" style="float: right;"><b>Speaker:</b> Yann Sionneau is a 26 year-old French embedded software engineer passionate about learning how embedded systems work in general.</p>

<p>Yann is part of the <a href="http://m-labs.hk">M-Labs</a> (fka Milkymist) community that is working on developing open source digital designs on FPGAs as well as making it more and more easy to do so by providing a simple but yet powerful framework for System-on-Chip design.</p>

<p>Yann contributed the original RTEMS Board Support Package of the Milkymist One video synthesizer, a Memory Management Unit (MMU) for the Open Source soft-core CPU LatticeMico32, and ported NetBSD kernel for the LM32 CPU and the Milkymist System-on-Chip.</p>

<h4>The Maker Movement meets patent law &ndash; how many windows are open in the patent fortress?</h4>

<p><img src="natalia_lukaszewicz.jpg" style="float: right;">As the Maker/DIY movement gets more technologically advanced, it encounters patent law.</p>

<p>The speaker argues that the existing patent flexibilities, e.g. private, non-commercial or experimental use, are too narrow to be maker-protective. Designed to safeguard the freedom to operate, they do not fulfil their role in this specific context. Additionally, the ongoing expansion of patent rights limits knowledge diffusion and the access to resources.</p>

<p>To support her hypothesis, she has conducted an online survey on the experience of makers with possible patent infringements. She also did a comparative analysis of patent tools employed in four patent systems (Germany, the US, the UK and Japan) that scrutinises the regulatory situation with regard to the freedom to operate.</p>

<p>She concludes that current patent law does not guarantee sufficient predictability, and under the dominating mind-set, patentee's rights are of higher concern and the balance of interests gets a raw deal. Makers are safe as long as their achievements do not generate much revenue and they do not "stick out".</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> Natalia Łukaszewicz is a PhD Candidate at the LMU Munich where she is finishing the project "A study on a patent exception for user-generated innovation". For a better understanding of patent environment she works at the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in Patents and Licensing Department. She did the master in European Studies (law &amp; economics) at Poznan University (Poland), and later participated in LLM Program at LMU Munich where she got into the field of intellectual property law.</p>

<h4>Optics &amp; Photonics with Lego<sup>&reg;</sup>-bricks: Open Hardware for young researchers</h4>

<p><a href="lego_interferometer.jpg"><img src="lego_interferometer_small.jpg" style="float: right;"></a>How to fascinate young researchers for the field of optics &amp; photonics? Is there any experimental platform for them to make research at a professional level? How can they follow their own ideas? These questions initiated the idea of transferring optics/photonics-experiments to schools and education by using Lego-bricks. The project essentially involves the development of experiments at professional level with excellent opto-mechanical quality at low costs. Construction manuals, parts lists, manuals for experiments, setup- and adjustment movies are published as open-source on the webpage of the research group. Relevant for publication is a feedback of the constructions with didactic studies and experiences of pupils and teachers. </p>

<p><img src="mirco_imlau.jpg" style="float: right;"><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="http://www.imlau.physik.uni-osnabrueck.de">Professor Dr. Mirco Imlau</a> is the head of the ultra-fast physics research group at the department of physics, University of Osnabrück. Born in Bergisch Gladbach, he studied physics at the University of Cologne and made his PhD on novel material classes for holographic data storage. After research stays in France and Switzerland, he was appointed as one of the first Juniorprofessors in lower Saxony to the University of Osnabrück in 2002. A visiting professorship at the University of Vienna followed in 2005 and he was appointed as full professor for experimental physics with focus on optics &amp; photonics in November 2008. His research interests involve novel phenomena &amp; effects for the ultrafast optical control of light, efficient solar-energy conversion and ultrafast 3D-imaging/microscopy.</p>

<h4>An Artistic Method: Two nontraditional approaches to glass</h4>

<p><img src="glassflex.jpg" style="float: right;">Justin Ginsberg will present a portion of his experimental artistic research with the glass working processes, which began in 2009. It was at this point that he recognized that glass, when very thin, was actually a flexible material. He will present the ways in which he constructs strands of glass, by hand, and with homemade machines, while also showing the development of the process, and the results through his artwork.</p>

<p>In conjunction with this research, he has also been experimenting with one of the more violent interactions he encounters in the studio when the 1260°C molten glass hits water. He has been attempting to capture the form, which is a result of this process, through photography, video, and the recovery of the actual glass objects.</p>

<p><img src="justin_ginsberg.jpg" style="float: right;">Both approaches will reveal a new way to look at this amazing material.</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="http://justinginsberg.net/">Justin Ginsberg</a> is a glass artist, and a visiting assistant professor and the head of the glass area at the University of Texas at Arlington. Justin's work explores non-conventional processes of working with materials.</p>

<h4>Basics of Quantum Cryptography</h4>

<p><img src="quantumlab.jpg" style="float: right;">Quantum Mechanics is the framework for the laws of nature that are relevant when dealing with very small length- and energy-scales. As has widely been popularized, quantum mechanics leads to rather counterintuitive behavior when we consider small (and in special circumstances, sometimes even large) numbers of atoms. Thus far, most, if not arguably all, technology we have still relies fundamentally on classical mechanics. But for the past 35 years, there has been a serious effort to understand what is technologically possible if we try to fundamentally take advantage of the quantum properties of nature.</p>

<p>The first technology to emerge from this line of thinking is "quantum cryptography", which in principle allows for completely secure communication, where the security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the features of quantum mechanics that are used in quantum cryptography schemes, and will discuss several proposals for quantum cryptography. I will also discuss how quantum cryptography is commercially implemented.</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~pmcmahon/">Peter McMahon</a> is a PhD student at Stanford University. He works on experimental implementations of quantum information processing technology, in particular optical control and measurement of quantum bits represented by electrons trapped in artificial atoms.</p>

<h4>Electron Beam Welding in Low Vacuum</h4>

<p><a href="eb_welder.jpg"><img src="eb_welder_small.jpg" style="float: right;"></a>Electron beam welding is a technique for joining metals and alloys that was initially used in the manufacturing of nuclear fuel for atomic reactors around 1950. It has now used many other applications. The principle is to melt materials by heating them using a focused high energy electron beam (usually 6 to 120 keV).</p>

<p>Traditional electron beam welders use a high vacuum &ndash; better than 10<sup>-4</sup> Torr &ndash; that is generated by a rotary pump and a diffusion and/or turbomolecular pump. The electron beam originates from a hot cathode. The focusing of electrons needs magnetic and electrostatic lenses. For those reasons, traditional electron beam welding equipment is complicated and expensive.</p>

<p><a href="eb_welder_plasma.jpg"><img src="eb_welder_plasma_small.jpg" style="float: right;"></a>Aleksander built something else: a small electron beam welder where a vacuum of 0.01-0.05 Torr is enough. This level of vacuum can be achieved by a cheap rotary pump. It even works better with a noble gas flow that stabilizes the pressure to 0.2-0.4 Torr to improve the emission of electrons from the electron gun. The electron gun is very simple: it consists only of an aluminum cold hollow cathode, brought to a negative potential of a couple kilovolts.</p>

<p>While this electron beam welder is not as good as traditional ones (poor focusing, lower energy of electrons), it is nevertheless possible to weld wires or thin plates of aluminum, copper, nickel and other materials.</p>

<p>Come and see live demonstrations of how to make a thermocouple in Aleksander's electron beam welder, and the effects of electron bombardment on other materials (including dielectrics like mica and glass).</p>

<p><a href="aleksander.jpg"><img src="aleksander_small.jpg" style="float: right;"></a>
<b>Speaker:</b> In 2006, Aleksander Zawada started his one-man DIY vacuum tube laboratory in Warsaw called "<a href="http://tubedevices.com/alek/pwl/pwl.htm">Prywatna Wytwórnia Lamp</a>". Now, having more space, more equipment (mostly from dumpster diving), and cooperating with friends, they created something similar to a small research institute, where they have a mechanical workshop, an electronics laboratory and a vacuum laboratory.</p>
<p>Aleksander is an employee of the Vacuum Measurement Laboratory of the <a href="http://www.itr.org.pl/en/">Tele &amp; Radio research Institute</a> in Warsaw, and of the <a href="http://www.ncbj.gov.pl/en">National Center of Nuclear Research</a> in Otwock-Świerk near Warsaw.</p>

<h4>VIRAC - Radio astronomy in Latvia</h4>

<p><img src="virac.jpg" style="float: right;">In 1994, the newly independent Latvia took over a formerly secret soviet military installation: The satellite tracking site at Ventspils, consisting of a 32 meter and a 16 meter dish. With its large telescopes in the middle of a huge, quiet, almost uninhabited stretch of forest along the Latvian coast, the Ventspils site is one of the most fascinating observatories to visit in Europe. After years of hard work by scientists and technicians from Ventspils University, the site is now operating again, but is now used as an astronomical observatory.</p>

<p>Roberts Trops and his colleagues will tell about this extraordinary project, starting from the time when this place appeared on no maps. The talk will cover the challenges of renovation and what has been achieved until now, the current applications for the two telescopes and how <a href="http://virac.venta.lv/en/">VIRAC</a> became a partner in the international astronomical community.</p>

<h4>Astropeiler Stockert</h4>

<p><img src="stockert.jpg" style="float: right;">Parabolic dishes dozens of meters in diameter, tracking systems for moving dozens of tons of mass with arcsecond accuracy, ultra-low-noise receiver frontends, FPGA spectrometers and GPU-supported analysis software &ndash; while radio astronomy may sound daunting for a hobby, it is a fascinating challenge.</p>

<p>The team of <a href="http://astropeiler.de/">Astropeiler Stockert e.V.</a> is one of the more active amateur radio astronomy groups in Europe. It runs the Stockert radio observatory near Bad Münstereifel. One 25 meter and one 10 meter radio telescope, formerly operated by the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, have been restored back to working order after years of neglect. Now, the telescopes are catching signals again, revealing the Milky Way's spiral structure, and faint, distant pulsars.</p>

<p>This talk presents the project's development from the first site cleanup in 2006 to the latest pulsar measurements only seven years later. Looking inside the machine room, we will give an overview of the entire control, drive and measurement toolchains used at the telescopes. The talk closes with an overview of the amateur radio astronomy scene in Europe and pointers to other interesting projects.</p>

<h4>[Tutorial] Bending Glass in Flames</h4>

<p><img src="glassworking.jpg" style="float: right;">

<a href="http://berlinglas.org/">Berlin Glas e.V.</a>, a non-profit public access glass studio.
</p>

<h4>[Tutorial] Learn to Solder</h4>

<p><img src="mitch_solder.jpg" style="float: right;"> A large variety of way cool kits are available, all designed for total beginners to complete successfully - and intriguing enough for the hardware geek. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman">Mitch Altman</a> will have kits available for making cool, practical, intriguing, hackable things that you can bring home after you make it.</p>

<p>Plenty of cool kits are available to make, including  TV-B-Gone (turn off TVs in public places!), Mignonette Game, LEDcube (animated 3D cube!), microcontroller programmers (program all your AVR family chips!), Arduino clones, Open Heart (animate fun patterns in the shape of a heart!), Atari Punk Console (make cool noise from an Altoids tin!), and many more.</p>

<p>Cost: Instruction is free, we ask that people pay only for the cost of the parts used; kit prices range from 10&euro; to 30&euro;. <strong>Suitable for kids</strong>, accompanied minors (-18) do not need a EHSM ticket.</p>

<h4>Inside the Genome Sequencing Revolution: Under the hood of an Illumina Sequencer</h4>

<p><img src="dna.png" style="float: right;">
Since the introduction of 'next-generation' sequencers, the cost of sequencing a single human genome has fallen exponentially; even <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/DNA_Sequencing_Cost_per_Genome_Over_Time.jpg">much faster than Moore's Law</a>. Modern fluorescence-based genome sequencers are complex instruments that can sequence billions of basepairs in a matter of days by sequencing millions of fragments of a genome in parallel. In this talk, I show how we have deconstructed one of the pioneering <a href="http://www.illumina.com/">Illumina</a> instruments, explain how it works, and show how we have managed to reconstruct an automated fluorescence imaging microscope system from scrapped Illumina sequencer parts.</p>

<h4>Open Source Verilog HDL Synthesis with Yosys</h4>

<p><img src="clifford_wolf.jpg" style="float: right;">
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> is the first full-featured open source software for Verilog HDL
synthesis. It supports most of Verilog-2005 and is well tested with
real-world designs from the ASIC and FPGA world.</p>

<p>Learn how to use Yosys to create your own custom synthesis flow and
discover why open source HDL synthesis is important for researchers,
hobbyists, educators and engineers alike.</p>

<p>The presentation covers basic concepts of Yosys and writing simple
synthesis scripts. There will be also a workshop covering advanced topics.</p>

<p>Yosys is the first step towards a fully open FPGA/ASIC toolchain, and is currently used with vendor place-and-route tools.</p>

<p><b>Speaker</b>: 
Clifford Wolf writes open source software and is active in the open source
and Linux community since the mid 90s. His prior projects include the Linux
distribution build kit <a href="http://rocklinux.net/">ROCK Linux</a> and the 3D CAD modeller <a href="http://openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a>. Since
2012 he is working on Yosys.</p>

<h4>Principles of Mass Spectrometry</h4>

<p>
<img src="massspec.jpg" style="float: right;">
Mass spectrometry is a very useful tool in solid-state physics research and material analysis.</p>

<p>The presentation will cover three spectrometry techniques: Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GDMS) and Spark Source Mass Spectrometry (SSMS).</p>

<p>It will explain the principles of operation and the construction of example devices and their "hearts" - quadrupole and double focusing mass spectrometers.</p>

<p>For a mass spectrometer to work, the analyzed material needs to be ionized first. The talk will show how that happens in SIMS, GDMS and SSMS.</p>

<p>Finally, the presentation will show sample measurement results.</p>

<p><b>Speaker</b>:
Maciej Miśnik is affiliated with the Vacuum Measurement Laboratory of the <a href="http://www.itr.org.pl/en/">Tele- and Radio Research Institute</a> in Warsaw, and the <a href="http://pg.edu.pl/welcome">Gdańsk University of Technology</a>.

<h3>Speakers: submit your presentation</h3>
<p>
Is there a device in your basement that demonstrates violations of
Bell's inequalities? We want to see it in action. Are you starting up a
company to build nuclear fusion reactors? Tell us about it. Does your
open source hardware or software run some complex, advanced and
beautiful scientific instruments? We are eager to learn about it. Do you
have stories to tell about your former job manufacturing ultra high
vacuum equipment in the Soviet Union? We want to hear about your
experiences. Do you have a great design for a difficult open source
product that can be useful to millions? Team up with the people who can
help implement your ideas.

<strong>Whoever you are, wherever you come from, you are welcome to present
technologically awesome work at EHSM.</strong> Travel assistance and visa

This year, we will try to improve the conference's documentation by
publishing proceedings. When relevant, please send us a paper on your
presentation topic. We are OK with previously published work, we simply
expect high quality and up-to-date content.

We will again have an exhibition area where you can show and demonstrate
your work - write to the same email address to apply for space. If you
are bringing bulky or high-power equipment, make sure to let us know:
<ul>
<li>What surface you would use</li>

<li>If you need 3-phase electric power (note that Germany uses 230V/400V 50Hz)</li>
<li>What the peak power of your installation would be</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Tutorials on any technology topic are also welcome, and may cater to all
levels, including beginners and kids.
</p>

<p>We acknowledge receipt of all submission emails; if you have not heard from us one week after your application, it means we have not received your message. Write again or call +4917639295103.</p>

We are counting on you to make this event awesome. Feel free to nominate
other speakers that you would like to see at the conference, too - just
