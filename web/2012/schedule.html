Mind you - when we say "comprehensive", this means things like building yourself ion chambers for detecting radiation, and studying and operating a small-scale homemade fusion reactor. Have a look at her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bionerd23">excellent videos</a>.</td></tr>

If you'd like to make a ring for somebody else, please try to measure their finger, or bring it with you!<br />
There will be a cost of 20 euro per person to cover materials so you can take your creation home with you.<br />
There are five spaces available in the workshop, but hopefully there will be enough time to squeeze two sessions into the slot. Each session should take 60-90 mins. Register at the conference cash desk.</td></tr>

The talk will briefly present the Electrolab hackerspace and all the fancy equipment we have to work on our projects. We will then present the vacuum chamber we are building from scratch using raw materials and a few hacked devices. We will describe the process used to build our own high vacuum flanges, the required skills needed to complete this project and the main difficulties we have been experiencing this year. To illustrate this talk, we will give some examples of particular technology needed for this project such as stainless steel 
machining, TIG welding or electro polishing which is quite more complicated than expected. Through our successes and our failures, you will discover the story of this quite unique home-made vacuum chamber.</td></tr>

It's getting increasingly easy to get our hands on advanced materials and manufacturing technology. Laser cutters and 3D printers, once expensive and arcane, will soon be in high street shops next to the laptops, phones and breakfast cereal.<br />
We geeks find it easy to look to the future, but age old hand craft techniques can often be far more powerful. In his work Jeffrey uses high- and low-tech in harmony.<br />
He will talk about a few of his projects focusing particularly on metalworking techniques; turning, milling, casting, welding, brazing, anodizing etc, but with digressions into electronics, adhesives, plastics and more.<br />
Before the talk, he'll be running a hands-on jewellery workshop. Learn to make your own silver ring and take it home with you!</td></tr>

This system works by scanning a very thin beam of X-rays across the target, and measures the amount of backscatter for a given beam position. The beam is scanned mechanically by a rotating chopper (collimator) wheel, and by tilting the rotating wheel on an orthogonal axis. The output image is generated on an oscilloscope by matching the horizontal scan speed to the rotating wheel, and using a potentiometer to measure the vertical axis position. The scope's brightness (z axis) is controlled by the amount of backscatter signal received by a large-area detector. Thus, the image is constructed bit by bit.<br />He might also 
talk about Raman spectroscopy and other hacks, stay tuned.</td></tr>

This can be achieved electrically with only one connection point to the wire using reflectometry methods. This involves various hardware platforms and signal processing sometimes similar to those used in radar systems. The measurement platform can either be made around a microcontroller or an FPGA and needs one analog high frequency input/output. <a href="http://blog.lelongdunet.com/?p=12">Adrien has worked on these issues</a> in the context of real time cable monitoring in vehicles.
