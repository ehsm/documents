				<p>EHSM will be a great opportunity to do science together: a hackathon will be carried out during 3 days to try and reproduce a <a href="http://quantumtantra.com/bell2.html">Bell test experiment</a>.</p>

				<p>This hackathon will let interested people participate and bring their ideas and equipment to the project, in order to obtain a better understanding of the physics involved. Technical decisions still need to be made, and the project will be thought out all along June to go as far as possible during EHSM. This month will also be employed to find the hardware required to successfully carry out this experiment. Feel free to contact the hackathon organizer if you wish to take part to the challenge, bring some equipement, or to ask for more details: antoinejeandet AT gmail.com.</p>

				<a name="Co-operative"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="Co-operative">"Co-operative 2.0" - company model for a fairer economy?</h4>
				<p><img src="fairnopoly.jpg" style="float: right;">The "co-op 2.0" is to establish a new type of company with a set of built-in characteristics and mechanisms which ensure the corporation contributes to a fairer and more sustainable economy.</p>
				<p>Based on the well-tried legal frame, the co-op 2.0 enhances the classical cooperative and takes it to the internet age. Its main features are democratic control, transparency, open source, involving and creating benefits for a lot of people (and not just a few) and fairness towards all stakeholders.</p>
				<p><img src="timo_buedenbender.jpg" style="float: right;">After presenting the model and its components using the example of its pioneer company <a href="http://fairnopoly.de/">fairnopoly.de</a>, I would like to discuss its potential and relevance. Can it be a lever to create a better economy? What other elements are necessary? All guests are invited to participate in the discussion and ask critical questions.</p>
				<p class="smaller"><b>Speaker:</b> Timo Büdenbender graduated in business administration in 2008 and now pursues projects in the green economy. He volunteers a part of his time to promote the co-op 2.0 as an "ambassador" in Hamburg.</p>
						
				<a name="kinko"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="kinko">kinko: e-mail encryption out of the box</h4>
		
				<p><a href="https://kinko.me">kinko</a> is an easy-to-use secure accessible PGP proxy in extra hardware,
				encrypting and decrypting emails for you. It is designed to be easy to use,
				<img src="kinko.jpg" style="float: right;">as it takes email encryption out of the email client into dedicated hardware, making encryption an automatic process. It uses open source encryption (e.g. GnuPG), and sensistive data (e.g. private keys) rests at your home in your control. The aim is to allow every person no matter their skills in computers to start encrypting emails.</p>

				<p class="smaller"><img src="leslie_polzer.jpg" style="float: right;"><b>Speaker:</b> Leslie Polzer first started tinkering with computers at the age of five. 25 years later he's fluent in various programming languages and UNIX systems and knows how to use this to build good software. At present he's working with a bunch of smart guys to make email privacy accessible to everyone. Besides software topics Leslie also has a keen interest in guitars and music, photography, DIY electronics and lots of other stuff that is way too much to fit into a 24 hour day, so he considers moving to another planet with longer days.</p>

		
		
				<a name="Lovelygraybuttons"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="Lovelygraybuttons">Lovely gray buttons: the open source history of widgets with snippets of code</h4>
		
				<p>The presentation covers a 30-years evolution of widget toolkits, which took place along with the historical changes in a desktop GUI. Widget toolkits are reviewed from three points of view: architecture, user experience, and programming principles. More than 90% of historically significant widget toolkits have open source licenses: some are opensourced after decrease of their commercial demand (like OpenLook and Motif), others are developed as a part of FLOSS world (TCL/TK, GTK+, QT) or in systems cloned by the open source community (Amiga, BeOS, etc.).</p>
		
				<p>Specifics of programming is reviewed on the basis of a typical hello world code examples used to compare complexity, readability and events processing. Alongside the source code, visual demo of the appropriate GUI is shown with use of virtual machines, embedded into the presentation slides.</p>
		
				<p><img src="dmitriy_kostiuk.jpg" style="float: right;">Reviewed toolkits of 1980s include Apple Lisa GUI, early Unix GUI of Andrew Toolkit and Project Athena, followed by OpenLook and Motif, and main non-Unix toolkits: WinAPI and NextSTEP GUI. Significant toolkits of 1990s include Intuition widget set from Amiga, TCL/TK, wide range of wrapper toolkits including MFC and Java AWT, main Linux widget libraries (GTK+ and QT), and Swing. Also the burst of visual theming occurred in the second half of 1990s is examined for Unix and Windows platforms (as in their artistic styles, so in used architectural approaches). Main milestones of post-Y2K widgets include Apple Cocoa style, slight decline of theming popularity in Linux world (supposedly Oxygen-driven), controversial Microsoft experiments with ribbons and its attempt to change the everywhere-used industrial visual style with the typographical one in Metro.</p>
		
				<p class="smaller"><b>Speaker:</b> Dmitriy Kostiuk works as an associated professor at Computers &amp; Systems dept. in Brest State Technical University (Belarus), being also a GNU/Linux &amp; free/libre software evangelist in this country, and also co-organizer of <a href="http://lvee.org">LVEE</a>, the main open source conference in Belarus since the year 2006.</p>
				
		
		
		
		
				<a name="Syntheticdiamonds"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="Syntheticdiamonds">Synthetic diamonds for the quantum computer revolution</h4>
		
				<p><img src="cvd_diamond.jpg" style="float: right;">
				The idea behind quantum computing is to use quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform data processing. However, applying these quantum concepts to macroscopic devices like computers is an enormous challenge for information scientists and physicists alike. What does it make so hard? Well, scientists have to find a material in which they are able to store and manipulate quantum bits (qubits). Since quantum states are very fickle and thus hard to abide, the most important task is to find materials in which qubits can be stored for a sufficient long time. Surprisingly they found these properties in diamond.</p>
				<p>This talk is an entertaining &laquo;tour de force&raquo; including a brief introduction to the fascinating yet strange theories of quantum physics, the concepts of using these in quantum computing and the latest results on qubits in devices made out of diamond. Moreover this presentation is given by a physicist who has been working on diamond for various other applications for years - who suddenly realized that he might have the material for the next IT revolution right in his lab.</p>
				<p>If you want to learn about the machines that might solve difficult problems in the coming years (such as intensive computations in astronomy, physics, and chemistry &ndash; or even decrypting your passwords) and how you can actually make your own diamonds from methane, hydrogen and a microwave source &ndash; this talk is for you!</p>
		
				<p class="smaller"><b>Speaker:</b> Nicolas Wöhrl joined the <a href="https://www.uni-due.de/cenide/">Center of Nanointegration</a> (CENIDE) at the University of Duisburg-Essen where he is working at the Nano Energy Technology Center (NETZ). NETZ is an application-focused research project. The aim of the project is to develop materials and also processes which allow nanotechnology to be used in industry &ndash; especially focused on energy applications. Currently, research focuses on developing materials and processes to be used in fuel cells, battery technology, catalysis, thermoelectrics and photovoltaics. His works include the atmospheric plasma treatment of surfaces for these applications to modify their surface properties and the synthesis of nanostructured carbon materials (NV-centers in diamond, nanocrystalline diamond, amorphous carbon, graphene, ...)</p>
				
		
		
				<a name="apertusAXIOM"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="apertusAXIOM">apertus&deg; AXIOM ­&ndash; the first FOSS/OH Digital Cinema Camera</h4>
		
				<p><img src="axiom_alpha.jpg" style="float: right;"><a href="http://apertus.org">apertus&deg;</a> is building the first ever free and open source software (FOSS) and mostly open hardware (OH) digital cinema camera: the apertus&deg; AXIOM. This talk will demonstrate the AXIOM Alpha proof of concept prototype and present the plans for the second incarnation, the AXIOM Beta which is targeted at developers and early adopters and has a focus on community input and hardware flexibility.</p>
		
				<p>The goal of the community driven apertus&deg; project is to create a variety of powerful, free (in terms of liberty) and open cinema tools that we as filmmakers love to use. The idea of building an open cinema camera was born in 2006, found many followers over the years and ultimately resulted in this project entitled "apertus".</p>
				 
				<p class="smaller"><b>Speakers:</b> Sebastian Pichelhofer (28) lives in Vienna, Austria and has spent the last six years working on apertus&deg; like if it was a paid job for him just without the money part... This dedication has over time made him an essential asset for the project and the team has rewarded him with electing him apertus° association chairman in addition to his role as project leader. Sebastian studied electronic engineering and software development but actually worked in
				the post­production department of a documentary film production before he got his current job in the multimedia department of a university.</p>
		
				<p class="smaller">Herbert Poetzl (43) lives in Austria, nearby Vienna, and joined the project in summer 2013 helping out with hardware and software development for the AXIOM Alpha and Beta. Herbert studied physics and computer sciences at the Vienna University of Technology and has a background in electronics, worked at various smaller and larger companies in Austria and then got self­-employed as IT consultant. He maintains Linux­VServer, a virtualization solution, since 2001 and participated in various projects like OLPC and PlanetLab.</p>
				
		
		
				<a name="PCBWriter"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="PCBWriter">PCBWriter</h4>
				<p><img src="pcbwriter.jpg" style="float: right;">The <a href="http://pcbwriter.github.io">PCBWriter</a> is a device to quickly produce high-quality printed circuit boards (PCBs). It uses a high power UV laser diode to directly expose the photoresist on the PCB. The direct exposure technique removes a lot of the typical problems with toner transfer or laser printer transparencies, allowing to reliably create PCBs even with the small structures needed for today's chips.</p>
		
				<p>Inspired by a similar project at "<a href="http://das-labor.org">Das Labor</a>" in Bochum, we have constructed a prototype device that we regularly use to produce PCBs. While there is still scope for improvement (as usual), the device is very handy if one quickly needs a PCB.  All code and schematics are available under a free license.</p>
		
				<p>We will give a brief talk introducing the basic method and our implementation of it. We will also bring our device and a few sample PCBs produced with it, give advice to anyone who wants to replicate it, and share our ideas about what to improve in the next version.</p>

				<a name="BorninUSSR"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="BorninUSSR">Born in USSR, died in Russia: an exploration of decaying Soviet technology</h4>
		
				<p><a href="lana_sator.jpg"><img src="lana_sator_small.jpg" style="float: right;"></a>The Cold War was a period of ambitious military, industrial and scientific projects, motivated by the competition with the opposing superpower. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many of their facilities were simply abandoned, forgotten and left to rot. Urban explorer <a href="http://lana-sator.livejournal.com/">Lana Sator</a>'s expeditions and pictures give a dramatic insight into the breadth of technologies that people can build given enough motive, and how frail those motives can be.</p>
				
		
		
				<a name="Themor1kx"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="Themor1kx">The mor1kx OpenRISC processor</h4>
		
				<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx">mor1kx</a> is a OpenRISC 1000 compliant softcore microprocessor written in Verilog. The initial motivation for the work at its inception was to provide a code base which would be friendly to multiple pipeline implementations, encouraging a high degree of reuse of common blocks. It initially saw the development of 3 different pipelines, each providing a different trade-off between area and performance. The most high-end pipeline has subsequently been honed by its developers to contain more features and better performance than the original OR1K processor, the OR1200.</p>
				<p><img src="julius_baxter.jpg" style="float: right;">Recent work includes cache and MMU features which improve the performance of software such as the Linux kernel. Other interesting work has been on enabling multi-core capability. This talk will present the OpenRISC project, the core and its current status, comment on its development environment (a nod to other open source EDA efforts), licensing, and current uses in various projects.</p>
		
				<p class="smaller"><b>Speakers:</b> <a href="http://juliusbaxter.net">Julius Baxter</a> is a digital design engineer who has been involved with the OpenRISC project for over 5 years. In that time he's dabbled with everything from RTL and the Linux kernel, to debuggers and licensing.</p>
		
				<a name="OpenTiled"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="OpenTiled">An Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip</h4>

				<p>With the increasing amount of processor cores, the traditional bus-based shared memory systems face the scalability issue. Modern manycore system-on-chip are therefore based on a network-on-chip. So called tiles are connected to the network and contain the actual processor cores. For research and prototyping of such system, we have started the Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip (<a href="http://www.optimsoc.org">OpTiMSoC</a>) project. It is based on the OpenRISC processor and contains all necessary hardware and software to start prototyping modern manycore platforms. This talk gives an overview about the project goals, the different development branches and future plans.</p>

				<a name="SmeltingattheElectrolab"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="SmeltingattheElectrolab">Smelting at the Electrolab</h4>
		
				<p><img src="smelting.jpg" style="float: right;">In a hackerspace, people often build things using various rapid manufacturing techniques. 3D printing, machining, laser cutting are common, but sometimes members need some bulky metal parts that are difficult to machine from a blank. Enter DIY smelting and casting, which is already a fun thing to do by itself, but is even funnier when it's elevated to a rapid manufacturing technique available to our members to build their projects. We will present our prototype furnace, some objects created with it in our hackerspace, and our current work on the "production" furnace, that will be able to melt 6 liters of aluminium, brass, copper, iron, etc... and also to convert cast iron into steel by controlling the amount of carbon. Some time will be dedicated to presenting the work in progress towards the <a href="http://electrolab.fr">Electrolab</a> v2.0.</p>
		
				<p class="smaller"><b>Speakers:</b> Sebastien Lorquet is a smart card and secure embedded software engineer during the day, and a hacker during the night. He's also an amateur radio operator and spends its free time experimenting with microwaves, electronics, mechanics and physics.</p>
				<p class="smaller">Tom Brelet is a Master's Degree student, intern at Peugeot, in a R&amp;D team. He has worked on a lot of personal projects involving soldering, melting, cutting and machining metal, most of them in his student bedroom.

				<p class="smaller">All are active members of the <a href="http://electrolab.fr">Electrolab</a> hackerspace, which provides them with important technical and human resources to work on more ambitious projects.</p>
		
		
		
		
				<a name="XRP"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="XRP">The eXperimental Robot Project</h4>
		
				<p><img src="xrpbot.png" style="float: right;">The goal of the <a href="http://www.xrpbot.org/">eXperimental Robot Project</a> (XRP) is to develop an open-hardware humanoid robot - or, more precisely, a bipedal walking machine. Much of the work until now has been on studying walking in simulation. In addition, to explore the application of optimization-based control to real world systems, we are currently building a so-called Acrobot (a double pendulum where only the middle joint is actuated).</p>

				<p><img src="osnt.jpg" style="float: right;">Despite network monitoring and testing being critical for computer networks, current solutions are both extremely expensive and inflexible. Into this lacuna we launch the Open Source Network Tester (OSNT), a fully open-source traffic generator and capture system. Our prototype implementation on the <a href="http://netfpga.org/10G_specs.html">NetFPGA-10G</a> supports 4x10Gbps traffic generation across all packet sizes and traffic capture is supported up to 2x10Gbps with native host software. Our system implementation provides methods for scaling and coordinating multiple generator/capture systems and supports 6.25ns timestamp resolution with clock drift and phase coordination maintained by a GPS input. Additionally, our approach has demonstrated lower-cost than comparable commercial systems while achieving comparable levels of precision and accuracy; all within an open-source framework extensible with new features to support new applications, while permitting validation and review of the implementation.</p>

				<p>In this presentation, I will describe the work I did on the open source LatticeMico32 softcore CPU to add a MMU (Memory Management Unit) to its pipeline and then how I added support for this enhanced LM32 CPU in the <a href="http://netbsd.org">NetBSD</a> 6 kernel.</p>
		
				<p>I will first quickly introduce the LatticeMico32 CPU and what FPGAs can do. Then I will focus on explaining what a MMU is and how the current MMU design that was added to LM32 works. I will then show an overview of the steps you need to accomplish to add support for a new CPU and a new System-on-Chip to the NetBSD kernel. Afterward I will explain some of the choices made for this port, especially those in relation with the handling of the MMU by the NetBSD kernel: the (machine-dependent) virtual memory system (aka pmap).</p>

				<h4 data-magellan-destination="MakersVSpatentlaw">The Maker Movement meets patent law &ndash; how many windows are open in the patent fortress?</h4>
		
				<p><img src="natalia_lukaszewicz.jpg" style="float: right;">As the Maker/DIY movement gets more technologically advanced, it encounters patent law.</p>
		
				<p>The speaker argues that the existing patent flexibilities, e.g. private, non-commercial or experimental use, are too narrow to be maker-protective. Designed to safeguard the freedom to operate, they do not fulfil their role in this specific context. Additionally, the ongoing expansion of patent rights limits knowledge diffusion and the access to resources.</p>
		
				<p>To support her hypothesis, she has conducted an online survey on the experience of makers with possible patent infringements. She also did a comparative analysis of patent tools employed in four patent systems (Germany, the US, the UK and Japan) that scrutinises the regulatory situation with regard to the freedom to operate.</p>
		
				<p>She concludes that current patent law does not guarantee sufficient predictability, and under the dominating mind-set, patentee's rights are of higher concern and the balance of interests gets a raw deal. Makers are safe as long as their achievements do not generate much revenue and they do not "stick out".</p>

				<p><a href="lego_interferometer.jpg"><img src="lego_interferometer_small.jpg" style="float: right;"></a>How to fascinate young researchers for the field of optics &amp; photonics? Is there any experimental platform for them to make research at a professional level? How can they follow their own ideas? These questions initiated the idea of transferring optics/photonics-experiments to schools and education by using Lego-bricks. The project essentially involves the development of experiments at professional level with excellent opto-mechanical quality at low costs. Construction manuals, parts lists, manuals for experiments, setup- and adjustment movies are published as open-source on the webpage of the research group.

It was at this point that he recognized that glass, when very thin, was actually a flexible material. He will present the ways in which he constructs strands of glass, by hand, and with homemade machines, while also showing the development of the process, and the results through his artwork.</p>
		
				<p>In conjunction with this research, he has also been experimenting with one of the more violent interactions he encounters in the studio when the 1260°C molten glass hits water.

				<a name="QuantumCryptography"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="QuantumCryptography">Basics of Quantum Cryptography</h4>
		
				<p>Quantum Mechanics is the framework for the laws of nature that are relevant when dealing with very small length- and energy-scales. As has widely been popularized, quantum mechanics leads to rather counterintuitive behavior when we consider small (and in special circumstances, sometimes even large) numbers of atoms. Thus far, most, if not arguably all, technology we have still relies fundamentally on classical mechanics. But for the past 35 years, there has been a serious effort to understand what is technologically possible if we try to fundamentally take advantage of the quantum properties of nature.</p>
		
				<p><img src="quantumlab.jpg" style="float: right;">The first technology to emerge from this line of thinking is "quantum cryptography", which in principle allows for completely secure communication, where the security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the features of quantum mechanics that are used in quantum cryptography schemes, and will discuss several proposals for quantum cryptography. I will also discuss how quantum cryptography is commercially implemented.</p>

				<a name="ElectronBeamWelding"></a>
				<h4 data-magellan-destination="ElectronBeamWelding">Electron Beam Welding in Low Vacuum</h4>
		
				<p><a href="eb_welder.jpg"><img src="eb_welder_small.jpg" style="float: right;"></a>Electron beam welding is a technique for joining metals and alloys that was initially used in the manufacturing of nuclear fuel for atomic reactors around 1950. It has now used many other applications. The principle is to melt materials by heating them using a focused high energy electron beam (usually 6 to 120 keV).</p>
		
				<p>Traditional electron beam welders use a high vacuum &ndash; better than 10<sup>-4</sup> Torr &ndash; that is generated by a rotary pump and a diffusion and/or turbomolecular pump. The electron beam originates from a hot cathode. The focusing of electrons needs magnetic and electrostatic lenses. For those reasons, traditional electron beam welding equipment is complicated and expensive.</p>
		
				<p><a href="eb_welder_plasma.jpg"><img src="eb_welder_plasma_small.jpg" style="float: right;"></a>Aleksander built something else: a small electron beam welder where a vacuum of 0.01-0.05 Torr is enough. This level of vacuum can be achieved by a cheap rotary pump. It even works better with a noble gas flow that stabilizes the pressure to 0.2-0.4 Torr to improve the emission of electrons from the electron gun. The electron gun is very simple: it consists only of an aluminum cold hollow cathode, brought to a negative potential of a couple kilovolts.</p>
		
				<p>While this electron beam welder is not as good as traditional ones (poor focusing, lower energy of electrons), it is nevertheless possible to weld wires or thin plates of aluminum, copper, nickel and other materials.</p>
		
				<p>Come and see live demonstrations of how to make a thermocouple in Aleksander's electron beam welder, and the effects of electron bombardment on other materials (including dielectrics like mica and glass).</p>

				<p><img src="virac.jpg" style="float: right;">In 1994, the newly independent Latvia took over a formerly secret soviet military installation: The satellite tracking site at Ventspils, consisting of a 32 meter and a 16 meter dish. With its large telescopes in the middle of a huge, quiet, almost uninhabited stretch of forest along the Latvian coast, the Ventspils site is one of the most fascinating observatories to visit in Europe. After years of hard work by scientists and technicians from Ventspils University, the site is now operating again, but is now used as an astronomical observatory.</p>
		
				<p>Roberts Trops and his colleagues will tell about this extraordinary project, starting from the time when this place appeared on no maps.
